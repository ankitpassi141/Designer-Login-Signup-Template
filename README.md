## 1.   Introduction

Design is simplistic and clean enough to be used in a Real-life Application.

## 3.   Running the Project
Clone the repository and open the "Mockup01.sln" to open the project in Visual Studio. Let it download all the packages required by project which is not a lot, just AppCompat libraries.

If you want to deploy "Mockup 01", In the file 
>MainActivity.cs
Change the "MainLauncher" to >True

If you want to deploy "Mockup 02", In the file 
>Mockup2_LoginScreen.cs

Will make a selection screen for Custom Dynamic UI loading in future.
